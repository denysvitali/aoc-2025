# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in Rust.

## AI-Generated Solutions

These solutions were **not written by a human**. They were generated by Claude (model: `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`), an AI assistant by Anthropic, using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) via [Happy](https://happy.engineering).

The human's role was limited to:
- Providing the puzzle input
- Copying the problem descriptions
- Verifying answers on the Advent of Code website
- Requesting commits and documentation
