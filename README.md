# Advent of Code 2025

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in Rust.

## AI-Generated Solutions

These solutions were **not written by a human**. They were generated by Claude (model: `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`), an AI assistant by Anthropic, using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) via [Happy](https://happy.engineering).

The human's role was limited to:
- Providing the puzzle input
- Copying the problem descriptions
- Verifying answers on the Advent of Code website
- Requesting commits and documentation

## Running Solutions

```bash
# Run a specific day
cargo run -p day01

# Run with optimizations
cargo run -p day01 --release

# Run tests
cargo test -p day01

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace
```

## Retrospective

This was a fully AI-generated Advent of Code completion. Here's a summary of the journey:

### Problem Types Encountered

| Day | Key Algorithm/Technique |
|-----|------------------------|
| 1 | Modular arithmetic, dial simulation |
| 2 | Pattern detection, repeating digit sequences |
| 3 | Greedy selection, digit concatenation |
| 4 | Grid traversal, adjacency counting |
| 5 | Range operations, set intersection |
| 6 | Column parsing, arithmetic evaluation |
| 7 | Beam simulation, ray splitting |
| 8 | 3D geometry, minimum spanning tree |
| 9 | Rectangle finding, coordinate geometry |
| 10 | State machines, button combinations |
| 11 | Graph traversal, path counting with required nodes |
| 12 | Polyomino packing, backtracking with pruning |

### Notable Challenges

**Day 12** was the most computationally intensive - the initial naive backtracking ran for 150+ seconds before optimization. The final solution uses:
- Area-based pruning (reject impossible regions early)
- First-empty-cell strategy for exact cover problems
- Final runtime: ~8.6s for all tests

### Performance

Most days complete nearly instantly. The slowest solutions:
- Day 12: ~8.6s (polyomino packing with 1000 regions)
- Day 10: ~0.8s (state machine exploration)
- Day 3: ~0.5s (greedy selection)
